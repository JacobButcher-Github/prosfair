## Rules

### Pieces

Each player begins the game with the following pieces:

1 King
1 Queen
2 Rooks
2 Bishops
2 Knights
8 Pawns

There are the following additional pieces that are available during the game:

Commander, Corpse Knight, Armed Demon, Shock Troops, Apostate, Insurgent, Berserker, Battle Sphere, Blood Signet, Warden, Hexmancer, Soulbinder, Mirror Stalker, Warp Javelin, Echo Knight, Aether Grasp, Crimson Bolt, Rune Beast, Clockblade, Ember Vassal, Tetherling, Lantern Monk, Plague Widow, Iron Herald, Gloom Warden, Shard Wolf, Mech Oracle, Bone Marshal, Storm Caller, Astral Blade, Hive Keeper

Each has special characteristics which will be listed later. They do not start on the main board, but rather will show up in separate board.

### Game Ending

The game ends if the Commander is placed in checkmate, very similar to normal chess. There are also alternative win conditions which might appear within the separate boards on Realms.

### Experience

Before tackling Realms, Experience must be explained. Every time a piece is captured, the player who captured gains experience. Experience is determined by the point value of each piece. This will be provided later in the rules, but for instance: Pawns are worth 1, Knights and Bishops are worth 3 experience each when captured. Players begin the game needing 2 experience to gain a level. Each level requires 1.5x more experience than the previous, rounded down. So level 3 would require 3 experience. Level 4 would require 4 experience. Level 5 needs 6, Level 7 needs 9 and so on. Every 2nd level, a player can choose to upgrade one of their pieces. So at levels, 2, 4, 6 etc.

Each unit and its subsequent upgrades are locked to certain "tiers" determined by level. Players will not be able to select certain pieces for upgrade if the upgrade is above the tier the game is in.

Player experience can have a gap, and gaps will mean that one player can obtain certain upgrades

### Realms

Each time a player levels up, a "Realm" is deployed for both players. Realms are separate boards that begin at 3x3 size, and will expand out as the level of the player creating it increases.At level 5, the board will become a 5x5. At level 10, the board will become a 7x7. And finally at level 20, boards will become spheres of tiles.

Each player will select a reward for "winning" the Realm when a Realm is deployed. Rewards can be the following: Experience gain equal to twice the length of the board, an instant upgrade to a piece on a different board, or moving of any piece from the Realm to the main board. As the size of the board increases, so do the number of rewards. With a 5x5 board, a player can select 2 rewards, including selecting the same reward more than once.

Players will first place a Commander piece in the back rank of the board. They are allowed to choose the position on the back rank. Then they will sequentially go back and forth placing pieces up to a point cap or unit cap.

In 3x3 boards 5 units total will be allowed to be placed (Excluding Commanders) and a point cap of 5 exists.

In a 5x5 board, 13 units total will be allowed to be placed (Excluding Commanders) and a point cap of 13 exists.

In a 7x7 board, 25 units total will be allowed to be placed (Excluding Commanders) and a point cap of 25 exists.

The player who "owns" that realm will be allowed to place their piece first, then players will sequentially place pieces one after another. However, the back rank must be filled in for both players.

Finally, to move pieces on Realms, a player must first capture a piece from a different Realm, including the main board. This can lead to sequences of many captures across many of the realms.
